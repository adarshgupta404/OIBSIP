    <p>
      Abdul Kalam Azad, also known as Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, was a prominent freedom fighter, scholar, and educationist during the pre-independence era of India. He was born on November 11, 1888, in Mecca, which is now in Saudi Arabia. He played a significant role in India's struggle for independence and also contributed significantly to the field of education in post-independent India.

      Azad was an ardent supporter of secularism and advocated for Hindu-Muslim unity. He was one of the leading figures in the Indian National Congress and a close associate of Mahatma Gandhi. Azad's contributions to the freedom movement and his efforts to bridge communal divides have left a lasting impact on India's history.
    </p>
    <p>
      After India gained independence in 1947, Azad served as the first Minister of Education in the Indian government. He believed that education was the key to the progress of the nation and worked tirelessly to promote education for all, irrespective of caste, creed, or gender. He played a pivotal role in establishing the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and the University Grants Commission (UGC).
    </p>
    <p>
      Azad's dedication to the nation and his vision for a united and educated India continue to inspire generations. His immense contributions to the fields of politics and education have earned him numerous accolades, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, which he received in 1992, posthumously.
